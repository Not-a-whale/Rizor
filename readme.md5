Hey. Look, it's my first time working with GSAP. So far I'm liking it a lot, but I haven't got much experience yet, so
some of this stuff will come out rough. 
I did perfect my html/css at least on desctop viewport so that it was visible that I know my stuff)) 

Please do use docker-compose up for setting up an environment for this project, although I'll do my best to put everything on heroku.
